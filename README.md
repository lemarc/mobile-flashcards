This is the Mobile Flashcards project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It is a react native app that bootstrapped with Create React Native App. You are able to create decks, add cards to decks, and quiz yourself on those decks. This app has been tested on the iOS Simulator and on an Iphone 6 with iOS 11.0.3.
