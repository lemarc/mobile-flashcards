# Mobile Flashcards
This is the Mobile Flashcards project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It is a react native app that bootstrapped with Create React Native App. You are able to create decks, add cards to decks, and quiz yourself on those decks. This app has been tested on the iOS Simulator and on an Iphone 6 with iOS 11.0.3.

## Installation
Download or clone the project.

From the project directory, run the command
```
yarn install
```

## Usage
### Starting the App
After installation and from the project directory, run the command
```
yarn start
```
You can then run the app in the iOS Simulator or on an iOS device with expo installed.
Note: The app may work on android devices but has not been tested.

### Create Deck
Click 'Create New Deck' to create your first deck. Enter a title and click 'Add'.

### Adding Cards
After creating a new deck or clicking on an existing deck, you can click 'Add Card' to add a new card to the deck. Enter a question and answer before adding the card to your deck.

### Quiz
As long as a deck has at least one card, you can start a quiz on that deck. This will go through each card in the deck that you can grade yourself on, with results after finishing all cards.
